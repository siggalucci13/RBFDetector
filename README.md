## Overview

This uses Ollama to try and percieve what expression you are giving off. This is to help those who get tired on long Zoom meetings and don't realize how bored or uninterested they seem. Every 10 seconds a picture will be taken , encoded , and run through Llava model using Ollama.

Info on Ollama:
